# To-Do List App

A simple and responsive To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage, ensuring data persists even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can input a task and add it to the list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Users can click on tasks to mark them as completed (strike-through effect).
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Data:** Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** The app works across various modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For the basic structure of the app.
- **CSS:** For styling and responsive design using Flexbox and media queries.
- **JavaScript:** For adding functionality, dynamic DOM manipulation, and localStorage integration.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

## How It Works
- **HTML**: The index.html file provides the structure for the input field, button, and task list.
- **CSS**: The styles.css file styles the app, including the layout, colors, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: The script.js file contains the logic for adding tasks, deleting tasks, toggling task completion, and saving data to localStorage.
